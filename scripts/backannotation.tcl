# This script runs SDF backannotation with a GateLevel Netlist
# Specifically, the script:
#       1) Opens a waveform with all the signals of the DUT
#       2) Opens a VCD database and dumps all signals into a VCD file
#       3) Opens a TCF database and dumps all signals into a TCF file
#       4) Runs the simulation
#   execute this script with the command: 
#           simvision -input backannotation.tcl 
#       or alternatively
#           xrun -f ../scripts/xrun_options.backannotation
